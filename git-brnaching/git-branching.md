# Git Branching

## Definition

Git branching allows developers to create independent lines of development within a repository. A branch serves as a separate workspace derived from the main codebase, enabling isolated changes, experimentation, and parallel development without disrupting the primary project.

## Advantages

- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
- **Isolation**: New features, bug fixes, and experiments can be developed in separate branches, preventing incomplete or unstable code from affecting the main branch.
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Teams can collaborate more effectively by working on their own branches and later merging changes when ready.
- **Version Control**: Branching provides a structured way to manage different versions of a project, making it easier to track and roll back changes if needed.

## Use Cases

1. **Feature Development**: When developing a new feature, a developer can create a branch, make changes, and merge it back once completed.
2. **Bug Fixes**: If a critical bug is discovered, a separate branch can be created to fix the issue without affecting ongoing feature development.
3. **Hotfixes**: Urgent fixes can be applied directly to production by creating a hotfix branch and merging it quickly.
4. **Experimentation**: Developers can create branches to test new ideas without impacting the stable codebase.
5. **Code Reviews**: Teams can use branches to submit changes for review before merging into the main branch.

## Basic Git Branch Commands

- `git branch` – List all branches
- `git branch <branch-name>` – Create a new branch
- `git branch -d <branch-name>` – Delete a branch
- `git branch -D <branch-name>` – Force delete a branch
- `git branch -M <branch-name>` – Rename the current branch
- `git checkout <branch-name>` – Switch to a branch
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>` – Create and switch to a new branch
- `git merge <branch-name>` – Merge changes from another branch
- `git rebase <branch-name>` – Rebase changes onto another branch

## Example Workflow

Imagine you are working on a large feature that requires multiple commits. Suddenly, your manager asks you to fix a critical bug. You don't want to mix your incomplete feature code with the bug fix. Branching solves this by allowing you to:

- Create a new branch for your feature.
- Switch back to the main branch to apply the bug fix.
- Continue working on your feature without interference.
