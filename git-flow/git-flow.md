# Git Flow

1. Team Lead creates the remote repository on git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), sets up the project structure, and shares the repository URL with the team.
2. Each team member clones the remote repository to their local machine. (Create a local repo and staging repo)
3. Each team member makes changes to the local repository (Working Area).
4. When the team member completes the changes, they move the changes to the staging area (ready to commit), it's like a checkpoint or add items to the cart. (Staging Area)
5. After reviewing the changes in the staging area, the team member commits the changes, it's like placing an order. (Commit History)

   **Note**: Commit: group of changes on a file or files. (related changes)

6. When completing the day's work, fixes, feature, or version, the team member needs to get the latest version from the remote repository to merge the latest changes with their changes to avoid conflicts. (pull)

7. After merging the latest changes, the team member uploads their changes to the remote repository. (push)
